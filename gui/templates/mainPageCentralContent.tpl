Phantom Published In The U.S. Today!
2 October 2012

Phantom, Harry Hole #9, is released in the U.S. today. The novel has been getting fantastic pre-publication reviews:
 
Nesbø begins with an emotionally gripping family drama but surrounds it with an elaborate, beautifully constructed plot involving [a] new drug and the ruthless man who rules its distribution. The subplots, plot twists (especially the last one), and the fully fleshed supporting charactersmany of whom could drive their own novelsare all testament to Nesbøs remarkable talent, but finally, it all comes back to Harry and the pain he endures in trying to carve out a separate peace from a world and a past that wont let him go. Superb on every level.
Booklist *Starred Review* (US)
 
Norwegian crime fiction writer Nesbø is one of the best . . . Oslos gritty and violent drug world is brought to life through the characters. The fast-paced plots are twisted and riveting, and the two stories collide to reveal a shocking climax. Nesbø is on par with the original Scandinavian duo Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö, authors of the Martin Beck series.
