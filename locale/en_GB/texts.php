$TLS_htmltext_title['assignReqs']	= "Assign Requirements to Test Case";
$TLS_htmltext['assignReqs'] 		= "<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>Users can set relations between requirements and Test Cases. A test designer could
define relations 0..n to 0..n. In other words, one Test Case could be assigned to none, one or more
requirements and vice versa. This kind of traceability matrix helps the investigation of test coverage
of requirements and identifies which ones were successful or failed during testing. This
analysis serves as confirmation that all defined expectations are met.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>While assigning requirements you can return to this instruction page by clicking on 
the name of the Test Project in the tree structure in the left panel.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Choose a Test Case in the tree on the left. The combo-box with the list of Requirements
	Specifications is shown at the top of the work area.</li>
	<li>Choose a Requirements Specification Document if more than one is defined. 
	TestLink automatically reloads the page.</li>
	<li>The middle block of the work area lists all requirements (from the chosen Specification) which
	are  assigned to the Test Case. The bottom block 'Available Requirements' lists all
	requirements which are not assigned
	to the current Test Case. A designer could mark requirements which are covered by this
	Test Case and then click the button 'Assign'. These newly assigned Test Cases are then shown in
	the middle block 'Assigned Requirements'.</li>
</ol>";

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Select your <i>Test Project</i> in the navigation tree (the root node). <i>Please note: " .
	"you can always change the active Test Project by selecting a different one from the " .
	"drop-down list in the top-right corner (provided you have rights on more than one Test Project).</i></li>
	<li>Create a new Test Suite by clicking on <b>New Child Test Suite</b> (under Test Suite Operations). Test Suites can " .
	"bring structure to your test documents according to your conventions (functional/non-functional " .
	"tests, product components or features, change requests, etc.) The description of " .
	"a Test Suite could hold the scope of the component Test Cases, default configuration, " .
	"links to relevant documents, limitations and other useful information. In general, " .
	"it would hold all annotations that are common to the Child Test Cases.</li> " .
	"<li> Test Suites follow " .
	"the &quot;folder&quot; metaphor, thus users can move and copy Test Suites within " .
	"the Test project. Also, they can be imported or exported (including the component Test Cases).</li>
	<li>Select your newly created Test Suite in the navigation tree and create " .
	"a new Test Case by clicking on <b>Create</b> (Test Case Operations). A Test Case is the " .
	"fundamental unit of testing; during execution it is determined to have passed or failed. It contains " .
	"a particular test scenario, the expected results and may have custom fields defined " .
	"in the Test Project (refer to the user manual for more information). It is also possible " .
	"to assign <b>keywords</b> for improved traceability.</li>
	<li>Navigate via the tree view on the left side and edit data. Each Test Case stores its own history.</li>
	<li>Assign your created Test Specification to a 	<span class=\"help\" onclick=
	\"javascript:open_help_window('glosary','$locale');\">Test Plan</span> when your Test Cases are ready.</li>
</ol>

<p>With TestLink you can organise Test Cases into Test Suites. " .
"Test Suites can be nested within other Test Suites, enabling you to create hierarchies of Test Suites.
 You can then print this information together with the Test Cases.</p>";

<h2>Requirements Specification</h2>

<p>Requirements are grouped by <b>Requirements Specification document</b>, which is related to a
Test Project.</p> 

<p>Requirements Specification documents can be arranged hierarchically. 
Create top-level Requirements Specification documents by clicking on the project node. </p>

<p>TestLink does not (yet) support versions for Requirements Specifications or
Requirements. So if a document version is required, it should be appended to the Specification <b>Title</b>.
A simple description or notes can be added to the <b>Scope</b> field.</p>

<p>The <b><a name='total_count'>Overwritten count of REQs</a></b> can be used to
evaluate Requirement coverage if not all requirements have yet been added to TestLink.
The value <b>0</b> means that the current count of requirements is used
for metrics.</p>
<p><i>E.g. SRS includes 200 requirements but only 50 are in TestLink. Test
coverage is 25% (assuming the 50 added requirements will actually be tested).</i></p>

<h2><a name='req'>Requirements</a></h2>

<p>Click the title of an existing Requirements Specification. You can create, edit, delete
or import requirements for the document. Each requirement has a title, scope and status.
A status should be either 'Normal' or 'Not testable'. 'Not testable' requirements are not counted
in metrics. This parameter should be used for both unimplemented features and
wrongly-designed requirements.</p>

<p>You can create new skeleton Test Cases for requirements by using the 'Create Test Cases'
button in the Requirement Specification screen. This leads to a screen where you can specify
how many cases are wanted for each Requirements document in the Requirements Specification.
These Test Cases are created in the Test Suite
with the name defined in configuration <i>(the default is: \$tlCfg->req_cfg->default_testsuite_name =
'Test suite created by Requirement - Auto';)</i>. The Title and Scope are copied to these Test Cases.</p>";

in your Test Plans if and only if the Test Plan contains the latest version of the Test Case.
If a Test Plan contains only older versions of a Test Case, assignments you make
now WILL NOT appear in the Test Plan.
</p>
<p>TestLink uses this approach so that older versions of Test Cases in Test Plans are not affected
by keyword assignments you make to the most recent version of the Test Case. If you want your
Test Cases in your Test Plan to be updated, first verify they are up to date using the 'Update
Modified Test Cases' functionality BEFORE making keyword assignments.</p>";

<li><b>HTML Email</b> - report is emailed to user's email address</li>
<li><b>Charts</b> - report include graphs (flash technology)</li>
</ul>

<p>The print button activates printing of a report only (without navigation).</p>
<p>There are several separate reports to choose from; their purpose and function are explained below.</p>

<h3>Test Plan</h3>
<p>The document 'Test Plan' has options to define a content and a document structure.</p>

<h3>Test Report</h3>
<p>The document 'Test Report' has options to define a content and document structure.
It includes Test Cases together with test results.</p>

<h3>General Test Plan Metrics</h3>
<p>This page shows you only the most current status of a Test plan by Test Suite, owner, and keyword.
The most 'current status' is determined by the most recent build Test Cases were executed on.  For
instance, if a Test Case was executed over multiple builds, only the latest result is taken into account.</p>

<p>'Last Test Result' is a concept used in many reports, and is determined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The order in which builds are added to a Test Plan determines which build is most recent. The results
from the most recent build will take precedence over older builds. For example, if you mark a test as
'fail' in build 1, and mark it as 'pass' in build 2, its latest result will be 'pass'.</li>
<li>If a Test Case is executed multiple times for the same build, the most recent execution will take
precedence.  For example, if build 3 is released to your team and tester 1 marks it as 'pass' at 2PM,
and tester 2 marks it as 'fail' at 3PM - it will appear as 'fail'.</li>
<li>Test Cases listed as 'not run' against a particular build are not taken into account. For example, if you mark
a case as 'pass' in build 1, and don't execute it in build 2, its last result will be considered as
'pass'. Test Cases are only considered 'not run' if they have not been run for <i>any</i> build.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following tables are displayed:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Results by top level Test Suites: </b>
	Lists the results of each top level suite. Total cases, passed, failed, blocked, not run, and percent
	completed are listed. A 'completed' Test Case is one that has been marked pass, fail, or block.
	Results for top level suites include all descendant suites.</li>
	<li><b>Results By Keyword: </b>
	Lists all keywords that are assigned to cases in the current Test Plan, and the results associated
	with them.</li>
	<li><b>Results by owner: </b>
	Lists each owner that has Test Cases assigned to them in the current Test Plan. Test Cases which
	are not assigned are tallied under the 'unassigned' heading.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Overall Build Status</h3>
<p>Lists the execution results for every build. For each build, the total Test Cases, total pass,
% pass, total fail, % fail, blocked, % blocked, not run, %not run.  If a Test Case has been executed
twice for the same build, the most recent execution will be taken into account.</p>

<h3>Query Metrics</h3>
<p>This report consists of a query form page, and a query results page which contains the queried data.
The Query Form Page presents with a query page with four controls. Each control is set to a default which
maximises the number of Test Cases and builds the query should be performed against. Altering the controls
allows the user to filter the results and generate specific reports for specific owner, keyword, suite,
and build combinations.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>keyword:</b> 0->1 keywords can be selected. By default - no keyword is selected. If a keyword is not
selected, then all Test Cases will be considered regardless of keyword assignments. Keywords are assigned
in the test specification or Keyword Management pages.  Keywords assigned to Test Cases span all Test Plans,
and span across all versions of a Test Case.  If you are interested in the results for a specific keyword
you would alter this control.</li>
<li><b>owner:</b> 0->1 owners can be selected. By default - no owner is selected. If an owner is not selected,
then all Test Cases will be considered regardless of owner assignment.  Currently there is no functionality
to search for 'unassigned' Test Cases.  Ownership is assigned through the 'Assign Test Case execution' page,
and is done on a per Test Plan basis.  If you are interested in the work done by a specific tester you would
alter this control.</li>
<li><b>top level suite:</b> 0->n top level suites can be selected. By default - all suites are selected.
Only suites that are selected will be queried for result metrics.  If you are only intested in the results
for a specific suite you would alter this control.</li>
<li><b>builds:</b> 1->n builds can be selected.  By default - all builds are selected.  Only executions
performed on builds you select will be taken into account when producing metrics.  For example - if you
wanted to see how many Test Cases were executed on the last 3 builds - you would alter this control.
Keyword, owner, and top level suite selections will dictate the number of Test Cases from your Test Plan
are used to computate per suite and per Test Plan metrics.  For example, if you select owner = 'Greg',
Keyword='Priority 1', and all available Test Suites - only Priority 1 Test Cases assigned to Greg will be
considered. The '# of Test Cases' totals you will see on the report will be influenced by these 3 controls.
Build selections will influence if a case is considered 'pass', 'fail', 'blocked', or 'not run'.  Please
refer to 'Last Test Result' rules as they appear above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click the 'submit' button to proceed with the query and display the output page.</p>

<p>Query Report Page will display: </p>
<ol>
<li>the query parameters used to create report</li>
<li>totals for the entire Test Plan</li>
<li>a per-suite breakdown of the totals (sum / pass / fail / blocked / not run) and all executions performed
on that suite.  If a Test Case has been executed more than once on multiple builds - all executions will be
displayed that were recorded against the selected builds. However, the summary for that suite will only
include the 'Last Test Result' for the selected builds.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Blocked, Failed, and  Not Run Test Case Reports</h3>
<p>These reports show all of the currently blocked, failing, or not run Test Cases.  'Last test Result'
logic (which is described above under General Test Plan Metrics) is again employed to determine if
a Test Case should be considered blocked, failed, or not run.  Blocked and failed Test Case reports will
display the associated bugs if the user is using an integrated bug tracking system.</p>

<h3>Test Report</h3>
<p>View the status of every Test Case on every build. The most recent execution result will be used
if a Test Case was executed multiple times on the same build. It is recommended to export this report
to Excel format for easier browsing if a large data set is being used.</p>

<h3>Charts - General Test Plan Metrics</h3>
<p>'Last test Result' logic is used for all four charts that you will see. The graphs are animated to help
the user visualise the metrics from the current Test Plan. The four charts provided are :</p>
<ul><li>Pie chart of overall pass / fail / blocked / and not run Test Cases</li>
<li>Bar chart of Results by Keyword</li>
<li>Bar chart of Results By Owner</li>
<li>Bar chart of Results By Top Level Suite</li>
</ul>
<p>The bars in the bar charts are coloured such that the user can identify the approximate number of
pass, fail, blocked, and not run cases.</p>

<h3>Total Bugs For Each Test Case</h3>
<p>This report shows each Test Case with all of the bugs filed against it for the entire project.
This report is only available if a Bug Tracking System is connected.</p>";
