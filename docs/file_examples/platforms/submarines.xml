		<name><![CDATA[USS Sturgeon (SSN-637)]]></name>
		<notes><![CDATA[Nuclear-powered Fast Attack Submarine Sturgeon was the first of a 37-boat class commissioned from March 1967 to August 1975. She was 292 feet (89 m) long and displaced 4,762 tons submerged. Her crew numbered 107. Power came from a single S5W (Submarine, Model 5, Westinghouse) pressurized-water nuclear reactor driving two steam turbines connected to a single propeller shaft. Sturgeon could make better than 20 knots (37 km/hr) on the surface, over 25 knots (46 km/hr) submerged (the exact figure remains classified).]]></notes>

		<notes><![CDATA[After the prolonged testing of a 1970 prototype, the Soviet Union built six Alfa-class boats between 1979 and 1983. These highly automated boats require only small, 30-man crews. Combining a liquid-metal cooled reactor propulsion system with a titanium hull, Alfa-class boats achieve exceptionally high underwater performance, a top speed of 43 knots (80 km/hr) and an operational depth of 2,000 feet (600 m).]]></notes>

		<notes><![CDATA[The largest submarines ever built, the first Typhoon-class ships entered service in 1977. They are 563 feet (172 m) long, have a beam of 81 feet (25 m). Performance figures can only be estimated: speed submerged, 30 knots (56 km/hr) and operational depth, 1,300 feet (400 m). Typhoons carry 20 SS-N-20 "Sturgeon" underwater-launched ballistic missiles.]]></notes>

		<name><![CDATA[Soviet Kilo-Class Diesel-Electric Attack Submarine]]></name>
		<notes><![CDATA[Unlike the United States, the Soviet Union continued to build diesel-electric submarines throughout the Cold War. Shown here is one of the most recent, a Kilo-class attack submarine photographed by a NATO aircraft. Kilo-class boats began to enter service in 1979 and are still being built for export. They have a surface speed of 12 knots (22 km/hr) and can make well over 16 knots (30 km/hr) submerged.

Diesel-electric submarines can be effective for missions such as coastal defense, where high speed and long range are not crucial. Operating on virtually silent electric motors underwater, they are inherently quieter than nuclear-powered boats with their coolant pumps. Diesel-electric submarines are also less costly to build and maintain]]></notes>
